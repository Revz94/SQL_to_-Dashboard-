###### Technology Used
           1.Design and Model Database: Use MySQL Workbench to design and model MySQL database schema. Create tables, define relationships, and populate the database with relevant data.
           2.Connect Looker Studio to MySQL Database: In Looker Studio, set up a connection to  MySQL database using the necessary connection details (host, port, username, password). This connection will allow Looker to access the data in  MySQL database.
           3.Define Data Models in Looker: In Looker Studio, create data models that map to the tables and views in your MySQL database. Looker provides a modeling layer that allows you to transform and aggregate data for analysis.
           4.Build Dashboards and Reports: With the data models defined,  use Looker Studio's drag-and-drop interface to build interactive dashboards and reports.Visualizations can be created based on the data models you defined.
